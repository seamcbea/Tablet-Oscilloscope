For operation as an android accessory

Hardware must support USB Host Mode
Ie. Must power the bus (sufficient current)
     Must provide enumeration function (ID Class of device and vendor, Load appropriate driver)

Look for MCU with - USB On the Go capability
Eg.  AT90USB646 (647, 1286, 1287)

	Must implement AOA v2 (Android Open Accessory)

		Summary:
Wait for and detect a connected device.
Determine the device's accessory mode support.
Attempt to start the device in accessory mode (if needed).
If the device supports AOA, establish communication with the device.

Power considerations 

Device requires on-board power. 
	5v wall wort. Or sufficient battery pack. 

5v - 500ma - to facilitate charging.
	This will meet the sufficient current requirement and charge the device since we are using up the usb port.
